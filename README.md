### State Management Strategy

- **Redux Toolkit**: Global state for auth, user profile
- **React Router Loaders**: Server-side data fetching
- **Custom Hooks**: Component-specific logic (usePickupVerification, useStorageOperations)
- **React Hook Form**: Form state and validation
- **Local State**: UI toggles, modal visibility

### Routing Architecture

```typescript
// Public Routes (no auth required)
/                  → Home (ItemsList)
/items/:id         → ItemDetail

// Protected Routes (authentication required)
/claims            → ClaimsList
/claims/:id        → ClaimDetail
/pickups           → PickupsList (with calendar/list toggle)
/pickups/:id       → PickupDetail
/lost-reports      → LostReportsList
/lost-reports/:id  → LostReportDetail

// Staff/Admin Routes
/storage           → StorageList
/analytics         → Dashboard
/admin/staff       → AdminStaff
/dispositions      → DispositionList
```
